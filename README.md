# MC-PEA Supplemental Code and Data Sets.

This repository contains the data for each of the figures in 'The Magnetic Cogging Parallel-Elastic Actuator for Energy-Efficient Robots'. The code and data are organized by subsection in the 'Results' Section of the paper. Addtionally, data and source code used to make the system identification figure (Figure S7) is also provided in the '/System\ Identification' folder. Python code requires at least python 3.10, with the pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scipy libraries installed. Python code should be run in its local directory in order for the program to find all relevant .csv files.

A CAD model of the prototype actuator assembly is also available in the home directory in the form of an IGES file.


Any questions about this data or source code can be emailed to welker.adam@utah(dot)edu
